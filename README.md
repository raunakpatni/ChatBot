# ChatBot
The Most Basic ChatBot
I used node js to write the code, using resify and botbuilder libraries.
You can use bot framwork emulator to test the bot .
It is simple just follow the steps:
>Install node and express on your computer
>Create new project and import restify and botbuilder in it.
>Create a .js file with the coding I gave in newbot.js.
>You will get a msg 'Listening to PORT 4567'
>Open bot framwork emulator and type 'https://localhost:4567' and hit enter
>Start chating with bot.

I just included very basic if else condition clauses, come up with great ideas and try to make it more realistic. 
You can even use REGEX to improve bot replies if you know a little bit of node js and reular expression.
